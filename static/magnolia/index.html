        <div class="content">
          After exactly 12 years, Magnolia DanceSpace closed its doors on October 31, 2019.

        <div class="content">
          Cheryl opened Magnolia on November 1, 2007 to provide low-cost rehearsal space for dance artists of all genres in the Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley area.
          Over the last 12 years Magnolia has hosted hundreds of dancers, actors, students, teachers, rehersals,
          classes, auditions and helped the founding of a ballet school and a martial arts academy.
          We appreciate all of the people that joined the Magnolia family and made our dancespace a
          friendly and fun place to be.

        <div class="content">
          Unfortunately we are no longer able to continue running Magnolia.
          One of our regular renters has taken over the physical space and has offered to continue renting to our customers when possible.
          If you are a regular renter and want to use the space, please contact Cheryl for
          how to contact the new management. If you are just discovering Magnolia, we are sorry we missed you.
