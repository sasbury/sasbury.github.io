    <h2>Settling in to Fog Creek from 2780 Miles Away</h2>

    <div>
        <p>As I approach my two month anniversary at <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com">Fog Creek</a> 
I have been thinking about being a remote worker. I worked remotely with TIBCO for close to 11 years, but
I was really more like someone that hid in their office for weeks only to
emerge on a semi-regular basis.  I would generally travel to Palo Alto and meet with folks 
every two to six weeks. I used that time to talk to others about plans and designs. 
In fact, I used to say that ever minute I spent at a desk in Palo Alto was a waste of money
because I could set at a desk at home. But in between my trips neither I, nor
the team, did a lot to build a strong communication channel.</p>
<p>Because Fog Creek is smaller and farther away I am trying to save money by reducing travelling. 
The company was already integrating group chat rooms, google hangouts and other techniques for
meeting over the net when I started, but I haven't totally integrated new ways of communicating.
I have the old fashioned attitude that I need to travel to talk to people.</p>
<p>While chatting with one of the other developers about hallway testing I realized something.</p>
<p>When you are a remote worker</p>
<h3>The internet is your hallway</h3>
<p>I don't have to travel to talk to people. I should use video chat, group chat,
chat rooms, and perhaps most importantly desktop sharing to shorten the
distance between my office and my team's. Successful group work is about communication.
I need to make time and prioritize inviting others
to share my desktop or spend time in a google hangout to discuss my status, design
ideas and double check my assumptions. Sharing my desktop can also allow me to have others 
test my work before it goes public.</p>
<p>The technology isn't really the point of this post. The main point is having
the right attitude. This is where I need to do some work. I need to change my
attitude, and re-program my brain. Instead of thinking about white boarding and 
knocking on a door to "bug" people, I need to think about desktop sharing and 
video chats.</p>
<p>The good news for me, is that I have learned a way to improve my work as
a remote worker. The bad news for my co-workers is that I will probably be
bugging them a lot more, and I suspect they will be seeing my poorly lit,
washed out face on their video screens more often. Sorry folks.</p>
