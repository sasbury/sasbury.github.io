    <h2>Creating an Operations Log</h2>

    <div>
        <p>As I mentioned in a previous post, I recently joined the Kiln team at Fog Creek. One of the effects of my move is that I have needed to learn how to help run Kiln both within Fog Creek and for our customers. Essentially I have been trying to learn how to be a good operator for Kiln. I have to admit that I am struggling with this transition. I have been pushing the team to create what I was calling an Operations Handbook. Some of this information is already captured, but I kept thinking we needed to organize it better.</p>
<p>Today I had an epiphany.</p>
<p>Creating an operations handbook is a lot of work, especially at a small company. Handbooks have to be maintained, edited and I want to say curated because that word has the gravitas of how much work a handbook can really be. What the handbook has, that I want, is a collection of information about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to solve specific problems</li>
<li>Known scripts and commands operations people use to do their job</li>
<li>Architecture information about how the system works</li>
<li>Administrative level information about machines, networks, addresses, memory, etc..</li>
<li>Pointers to monitoring pages, tasks, scripts and logs</li>
<li>Some place for new group members to go to learn about the product's operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that all of these things change over time. So making a handbook is not only a hard process at the start, it is an ongoing hard process that requires constant attention.</p>
<p>My epiphany is that by changing my goal from a <em>handbook</em> to a <em>log</em> I can get everything I want without the same kind of maintenance requirements. My idea is simple, using blog software, the team can simply document operations issues and solutions. Each time a problem comes up, the person that investigates it can simply type up a post about what they did and what they found. As we build a set of posts, the log becomes a searchable resource for operations folks to use to find scripts, commands and ideas for solving problems.</p>
<p>We can also start to capture log posts that are more than a simple "found a problem with X and fixed it by running Y." These longer posts, or articles, can capture architecture. Shorter posts by administrators can indicate new machines or changing machine resources.</p>
<p>So why is the log better than the handbook?</p>
<p>A log is a series of entries organized by time. A handbook is an organized collection of information. The handbook has to be updated over time. The log is just added to. Ultimately I think the log will be easier to create and keep up to date. I think the log will be easier for the entire team to contribute to in real time.</p>
<p>Update 5/11/2014 - We have implemented an operations log for the Kiln team and I am looking forward to posting some updates on the Fog Creek Site soon.</p>
